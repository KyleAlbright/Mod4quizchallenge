# User Story
```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```
### Usage
When the user is presented with the opening screen, they are given the rules for the coding quiz.They can look at the previous high scores by following the "view high scores" link. The quiz will start as soon as the user clicks start. When the user clicks start, the timer will start from 60 and tick down every second. They will be asked to answer 5 questions pertaining to coding. If the user gets the question correct, they will be awarded 5 points. If they get the question wrong, 10 seconds will be taken off the clock. If the user runs out of time they will be taken to a game over screen, where they will be able to start the quiz over from the beginning. If the user answers every question, they will be brought to the final screen. On this screen their final score will be displayed, and they will be able to enter their initials to be displayed on the high scores page.
